# Delphi-HTMX-Todo

This demo is about htmx support in DMVCFramework.

It uses:
- [DMVCFramework](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework)
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- [TemplatePro](https://github.com/danieleteti/templatepro)
- MVCActiveRecord (with a SQLite database)

[My Blog](https://www.danieleteti.it)

Tested on MS Windows but it should work also for Linux
